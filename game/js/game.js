Everybody saw the sunshine. Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah. Everybody had a good year. Everybody let their hair down. Everybody pulled their socks up, yeah. Everybody put their foot down, oh yeah. I've got a feeling, a feeling deep inside, oh yeah.  Everybody had a wet dream, oh yeah. Everybody saw the sunshine. I've got a feeling, a feeling I can hide, oh no.
