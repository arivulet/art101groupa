			"Here she comes You better watch your step Shes going to break your heart in two its true Its not hard to realize Just look into her false colored eyes Shell build you up to just put you down what a clown Cause everybody knows Shes a femme fatale The things she does to please Shes a femme fatale Shes just a little tease Shes a femme fatale See the way she walks Hear the way she talks Youre written in her book Youre number thirtyseven have a look Shes going to smile to make you frown what a clown Little boy shes from the street Before you start youre already beat Shes going to play you for a fool yes its true Cause everybody knows Shes a femme fatale The things she does to please Shes a femme fatale Shes just a little tease Shes a femme fatale See the way she walks Hear the way she talks Cause everybody knows Shes a femme fatale The things she does to please Shes a femme fatale Shes just a little tease Shes a femme fatale Oh woah woah Shes a femme fatale Oh woah woah Shes a femme fatale Oh woah woah Shes a femme fatale",
